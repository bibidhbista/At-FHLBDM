ExamDiff is a freeware Windows tool for visual file 
comparison. It has a number of simple and convenient 
features that many users have been asking for a long time 
from a file comparison tool.

-Remembers a user specified number of last compared first 
 and second files. This allows quick selection of the two 
 files the user wishes to compare. 

-There is no need to specify both filenames -- just enter
 a directory name for one of the files to be compared. 
asdf
 or second file, and line number option (available for
 editors that support this, through ExamDiff variables: 
 $FILE (first or second file name), $CURDIFF (number of 
 line at which the current difference starts), and 
 $CARET (number of line where the caret is located)).

-Saves the file differences in a standard UNIX DIFF file.

-Easy navigation through the differences via "Next 
 Difference"/"Current Difference"/"Previous Difference" 
 buttons and hot keys or via a list box of all the differences.

-Allows the copying of text from the comparison panes via 
 drag and drop, a hot key, or a right button pop up.

-Simple "Search" command to search for strings in the 
 comparison panes. It also remembers a user	specified 
 number of most recent searches. 

-Customizable text and background colors, font, tab size, 
 and "Show Differences Only" option as well as options to 
 "Ignore white spaces in lines", "Ignore changes in amount of 
 white spaces in lines", "Ignore case",  "Treat files as text 
 files", "Ignore leading white space in lines" and 
 "Ignore trailing white space in lines" for comparison.

-Fully customizable file extension filter. For example, the 
 user can choose only .c and .cpp files or any other files

                two filenames are used
          /aN   scroll trough all differences with N second delay 
                and exit after the last difference
          /?,/h print this screen
       NOTE: if options /i, /w, /b, /l, /e, /t, or /d are not set, 
             the last used options remain in effect.
